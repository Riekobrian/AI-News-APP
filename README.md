Objective and Plan Overview
Our objective is to build an AI news app that crawls news websites, extracts articles, rates their tonality as positive, neutral, or negative, and provides summaries based on this tonality. The app can be developed using React for the front-end or HTML/CSS/JavaScript, with a back-end likely needed for heavy lifting like crawling.
